snakestep is a Step sequencer for sequencing synths and drum machines. 

I am making it so I can use my Raspberry PI to sequence my synths etc, so 
I don't need a normal computer to do it. There is a design challenge to 
use the simplest possible GUI such that it can display on a cheap 
sysinfo type display LCD sys info, with this library:

It is based on an earlier thing called the FinnPhonium, which was built as a 
function sequencer, relying on supercollider but with a Processing GUI.
